## Approach & Efficiency
### The approach taken by the list function to reverse an array is straightforward and involves iterating through the input array and adding each element at the beginning of a new array using the unshift operation 
### Efficiency is a crucial consideration when designing algorithms and writing code. It refers to how well an algorithm performs in terms of time and space requirements.
